This project is an application I developed during my learning process of Microservices Architecture. My goal was to demonstrate how microservices can work independently, have their own databases, and how communication between services can be established.

About the Project
This project was developed to implement the basic principles of microservices architecture, aiming to facilitate communication and interaction between independent modules. The project demonstrates how each microservice is designed independently and how these services interact with each other, as well as how modern approaches such as security and configuration management are integrated.

Technologies Used
Backend: Spring Boot
Database: H2 (Lightweight, in-memory database for local development)
Service Discovery: Eureka (For service discovery between microservices)
API Communication: Feign Client (For communication between services)
Security: Spring Security (For authentication and authorization)
Configuration Management: Configuration files pulled from GitHub (Centralized configuration for each microservice)
